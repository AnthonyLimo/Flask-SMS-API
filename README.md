# Flask SMS API

To get this app up and running (pun intended), fork and clone this repository. After the clone, run `source ./venv/bin/activate` to install the pip dependencies for the app.

Run `flask run` to get it all started.


Currently, I only have a `sms_sending` function. But more stuff will come in later as more front end applications in React, Angular and Vue. Stay tuned.
